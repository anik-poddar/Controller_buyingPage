# Controller_buyingPage
This project is a web page that allows users to buy different types of controllers for gaming consoles. The page is created using HTML and CSS, following the tutorial of GreatStack, a YouTube channel that teaches web development skills. The page has a simple and responsive design, with a header, a navigation bar, a product grid, and a footer. The user can select the controller they want, see the price and features, and add it to the cart. The page also has some animations and transitions to make it more interactive and appealing. The project is hosted on GitHub Pages and can be accessed from any device.
